**Ice Cream Parlor Cafe Management System**
This is a user-friendly application designed to streamline operations at an ice cream parlor. The application includes features to view and manage seasonal flavors, maintain a cart for customer orders, and handle customer allergy records. Built with Python's tkinter library and backed by a SQLite database, this application offers a simple graphical interface for efficient parlor management. Key functionalities include:

Seasonal Flavors: Browse available flavors, view their descriptions, and add them to the cart.
